# EkPoGo-Discord-Bot
This is the discord bot we use in east kent pogo, it helps us organise raids. It works, but was written hastily. There's a lot that could be improved, but it does work :)

There's a few servers that are using it now besides ours, so I figured it needed to go on github. Patches welcome :)
